/**
 * Default per-operation timeout for the embedded worker store. The worker is
 * a SINGLE thread that processes store ops FIFO, so one slow / wedged op (a
 * huge import, an expensive query, or a genuinely hung worker) blocks every
 * other store-backed request queued behind it. Without a bound, the caller —
 * an API route, the publisher, gossip ingest — waits FOREVER. That is the
 * exact signature behind issues #997 / #999 / #1002 / #1005 / #1008:
 * `/api/status` (no store) stays green while `/api/query`,
 * `/api/context-graph/list`, `/api/assertion/create` never return.
 *
 * A bounded wait turns an indefinite hang into a surfaced error the operator
 * can act on (the message points at the real fix: use an external SPARQL
 * server for heavy workloads). 120s is generous enough not to trip normal
 * operations yet finite. Set `operationTimeoutMs: 0` to restore the old
 * unbounded behaviour.
 *
 * IMPORTANT — the timeout is applied to READ-ONLY ops only (see
 * READ_ONLY_METHODS). A read is side-effect-free, so bounding the caller's wait
 * and rejecting is always a clean, determinate failure. A mutation is NOT
 * bounded: the timeout only drops the caller's promise while the single worker
 * thread keeps running the op, so a "timed-out" insert/delete could STILL
 * commit afterwards — and the rest of the codebase treats a rejected
 * insert/delete as a clean failure, which would leave partial state visible and
 * retries ambiguous. The user-visible hang in the issues above is on the read
 * paths (`/api/query`, `/api/context-graph/list`); bounding reads surfaces a
 * wedged worker there without inventing an indeterminate mutation outcome.
