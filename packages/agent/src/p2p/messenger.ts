 *
 * Both surfaces share the same underlying `ProtocolRouter` — the
 * substrate is a wrapper, not a replacement.
 *
 * Construction:
 *
 *   - PR-2 makes `idempotencyStore` + `outboxStore` optional so
 *     existing test sites (`p2p-messenger.test.ts`) keep working
 *     without store fixtures. When a caller invokes `sendReliable`
 *     without stores wired, the method throws a typed
 *     `MessengerNotConfiguredError` so misconfiguration surfaces
 *     loudly rather than silently regressing reliability.
 *
 *   - PR-3 wires the SQLite-backed stores in `cli/src/daemon/
